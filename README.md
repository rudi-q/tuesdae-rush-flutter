## 🎮 Game Overview

**Tuesdae Rush** transforms everyday traffic management into an engaging, stress-free gaming experience. Players control traffic lights at a 4-way intersection, helping colorful cars pass through safely while avoiding collisions.

- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tuesdae-rush-flutter.git
   cd tuesdae-rush-flutter
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the game**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Platform-Specific Setup

#### 📱 Mobile (Android/iOS)
```bash
# Android
flutter run -d android

# iOS (macOS only)
flutter run -d ios
```

#### 🌐 Web
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

#### 💻 Desktop
```bash
# Windows
flutter run -d windows

# macOS

# Linux
flutter run -d linux
```

## 🎮 How to Play

### Basic Controls
- **Touch/Tap**: Click any traffic light to toggle between red and green
- **Arrow Keys**: Use keyboard arrows (↑↓←→) to control specific lights
- **Number Keys**: Press 1-5 to change difficulty levels
- **Spacebar/Escape**: Pause and resume the game
- **R Key**: Restart after game over

### Game Objective
1. **Control traffic lights** to help cars pass through the intersection safely
2. **Avoid collisions** between vehicles from different directions
3. **Manage traffic flow** to prevent too many cars from waiting
4. **Complete objectives** for bonus points and achievements
5. **Maintain high efficiency** to avoid game over

### Traffic Light Logic
- **Red Light**: Cars stop 30 pixels before the intersection
- **Green Light**: Cars proceed through the intersection
- **Each direction is independent** - you can have multiple greens
- **Emergency vehicles** (ambulances, police) ignore traffic lights

### Scoring System
- **Base points per car**: Varies by difficulty (1-3 points)
- **Crash penalty**: -5 points (score cannot go below 0)
- **Objective bonuses**: 50-300 points for completing challenges
- **Success rate tracking**: Percentage of cars that pass safely

## 🏆 Objectives & Achievements

| Objective | Requirement | Bonus |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Pass 20 Cars** | Get 20 cars through safely | +50 points |
| **Perfect Safety** | No crashes with 10+ cars passed | +100 points |
| **Pass 50 Cars** | Reach 50 successful passages | +150 points |
| **High Efficiency** | 85% success rate with 20+ cars | +200 points |
| **Century Mark** | Pass 100 cars successfully | +300 points |
| **Traffic Master** | Keep waiting cars ≤3 with 30+ passed | +250 points |

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Project Structure
```
lib/
├── main.dart              # Main app entry point and UI
├── game_state.dart        # Game logic and state management  
└── game_painter.dart      # Graphics rendering and effects
```

### Key Components

#### `main.dart` (~500 lines)
- Flutter app setup and theming
- UI overlays (score, objectives, controls)
- Input handling (touch, keyboard)
- Responsive layout management
- Theme switching (dark/light mode)

#### `game_state.dart` (~600 lines)
- Complete game logic and mechanics
- Car spawning, movement, and collision detection
- Traffic light state management
- Objectives and scoring system
- Difficulty scaling and balance

#### `game_painter.dart` (~500 lines)
- CustomPainter for all game graphics
- Road, intersection, and scenery rendering
- Vehicle drawing with special effects
- Particle systems and animations
- Visual effects (explosions, glows, popups)

### Performance Optimizations
- **60 FPS game loop** with optimized rendering
- **Efficient collision detection** using distance calculations
- **Memory management** with proper object cleanup
- **Responsive scaling** that adapts to any screen size
- **Fixed random seeds** for consistent visual elements

## 🧠 ADHD-Friendly Design Principles

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Single primary task**: Focus only on traffic light control
- **Clear visual hierarchy**: Important elements have high contrast
- **Predictable patterns**: Cars follow consistent, logical rules
- **Immediate feedback**: Every action has instant visual response

### Attention & Focus
- **No time pressure**: Play at your comfortable pace
- **Multiple input methods**: Touch, keyboard, or mouse
- **Visual rewards**: Positive reinforcement through animations
- **Progress tracking**: Clear objectives and statistics

### Sensory Considerations
- **Calming color palette**: Forest green background reduces stress
- **High contrast**: Essential elements are clearly distinguishable
- **Consistent animations**: Smooth, predictable movement patterns
- **Optional sound**: Visual-first design doesn't rely on audio

### Executive Function Support
- **Clear cause-and-effect**: Traffic light → car behavior
- **Structured objectives**: Specific, achievable goals
- **Performance feedback**: Real-time success rate tracking
- **Error forgiveness**: Crashes reduce score but don't end game

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Features

#### New Vehicle Type
```dart
// 1. Add to CarType enum in game_state.dart

  // Custom rendering
}
```

#### New Objective
```dart
// Add to objectives map in game_state.dart
Map<String, bool> objectives = {
  'new_objective': false,
};

// Add check in _checkObjectives()
if (condition && !objectivesCompleted['new_objective']!) {
  objectives['new_objective'] = true;
  objectivesCompleted['new_objective'] = true;
  _awardObjectiveBonus('New Achievement', 100);
}
